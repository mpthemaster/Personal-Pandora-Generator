Child
Children provide an interesting alternative to other character types. A child character will typically have an above average Empathy and Perception but a much lower than average Strength. For this reason, a player only has 90 Stat points to distribute to child characters and will always have Size: 0 to represent their small size and lack of ability to defend themselves against larger attackers.
