Agility - (Tier 1)
Characters with this skill get a +5 bonus to Strength for climbing and jumping. They also get +1 Defense due to an increased ability to dodge; this bonus is not given to a character that is Surprised or Panicked. This skill may push a character above their normal maximum of having a Base Defense of 5. In addition, a character with this skill is capable of moving their body to reduce the effectiveness of attacks made against them. This includes attacks made by zombies. If a character with this skill loses a Grapple check then every area of their body has a base Bite Resistance of 15%. This can be combined with physical armor, but only grants an additional +5% to the armor's Bite Resistance instead of the normal +15%.

Archery - (Tier 3)
A character has had significant practice with a bow and arrow and can accurately shoot one. When using bow style weapons, a character can add half of their Perception attribute to their close damage range to a maximum total ZK% of 50%. The exception to this is compound bows which have no cap on the maximum total ZK% granted by this skill. If characters do not move, then they may add this bonus to the medium damage range as well. At long range, a hit is nearly impossible without this skill. Otherwise, the long range is reduced to having a 5% chance of causing a kill, even if it would normally be higher.

It is treated as having whatever Defense they would have had if they were not restricted to 5. Note that a character may not perform any other actions while 'Defending' other than make Grapple checks and move. A character that is Panicked may not use this ability.

Attacks using thrown weapons, grenades and Molotov cocktails increase their Lethality by 10 at all ranges, and Lethalities that are marked with a 0 count as 10 when thrown by a character with this skill. Lethalities marked with a (-) are unchanged, however.

Your style of shooting is saturation based. While this is not the best tactic for combating zombies, you seem to compensate by being able to maintain accuracy despite the volume of shots you fire. Character may increase the FC of any handgun they carry by 2 if they're firing at one target, or they can fire at multiple targets without taking penalties for firing at multiple targets. You still take penalties for firing multiple shots.

Gunsmithing - (Tier 4)
You excel at tinkering with firearms to make them more effective. More often than not, this skill is used to make non-intrusive modifications that simply undo the government mandated restrictions that put a damper on ammo capacity or rate of fire. A character can clear jammed firearms in the field as a regular action during an encounter. They may also reduce the Degradation of gun cleaning kits by half. This skill also represents a character's ability to modify firearms to be more effective at dealing damage or improving their capacity or rate of fire; unfortunately, this makes weapons more dangerous and frequently damages the weapon. The more extensive the modification, the less stable the weapon becomes. Most of these modifications are undoing modifications to the weapons that are government mandated. Regardless of the desired modification, the modification itself is taken as an ‘Equipment Manufacture’ mission and can be one of the following: Ammo Increase: Increase the Ammo of a weapon by 20% by removing government mandated ammo plugs. This modification can be made to magazines as well as firearms themselves, provided the firearm does not hold their ammunition in magazines. No side effects. Tinker: Increase the chance of success of any Stronghold mission that involves the maintenance, repair or modification of firearms by +15%. Rapid Fire: Increase FC of a weapon by 25% rounding down. Each time the player fires more than the weapon's original FC the weapon is subject to 'Dulling'. Armor Piercing: Increase all Lethalities by 15. Weapon is subject to 'Dulling'.

Handyman - (Tier 3)
A professional jack-of-all-trades, the handyman is knowledgeable about many aspects of home maintenance which are valuable when maintaining a stronghold. Characters with this skill have basic working knowledge of construction, wiring, plumbing and mechanics, and given the proper tools this character is capable of working on any of these areas. These people also have a strong working knowledge of tools and their proper use. Grant this character a +5 bonus to Perception when making any checks for upgrades to the Stronghold or item creation. Note that using Gestalt dice to increase the bonus only applies to one kind of area of knowledge (construction, wiring, plumbing, etc.), not all of them.

Increase Health recovery during natural healing by 1d6. The target must not move or perform any actions. If the character with this skill has any other first aid skill then they can increase the natural healing by +2 (so 1d6 would become 1d6+2) from the existing bonus.

This is not a common skill as it is difficult to practice this skill effectively in a humane fashion. Basically, having this skill means that a person has no problem using a knife in ways that will deliver nothing short of lethal blows without hesitation. ZK% can exceed 15% when the character uses knife weapons or 30% in the case of Combat Knives or 65% in the case of a Seax. It takes an additional degree of failure for a knife or slashing weapon to be subject to 'Dulling'. Increase the Grappling Strength bonus granted by using a knife or any short piercing or slashing weapon by +5. If the weapon grants no bonus of this kind, then it now grants a bonus of +5 for Grappling.

Lone Wolf - (Tier 1)
The rugged individualist will often opt to work independently even when among others. The lone wolf is very much aware of their own ability and limitations, enough so that they often know what to do while others may be bogged down with group dynamics. A lone wolf does not get bonuses for being in any formation nor can they take the ‘Co-op (name)’ skill, but they get a +5 bonus to their Perception and Will which is increased to +10 for ‘Per - Hide, Search, Spot and Survival’ checks. While part of a marching order, they can perform any kind of action but will not get any benefit to taking any position. If the character wishes to take this as a 2nd Tier skill, then they also have the added benefit of not being counted as having participated in a mission when determining the Risk of a mission. Generating Noise and doing other Risk-increasing activities still count, however. Gestalt Dice can be used to increase this skill, but they only increase Perception or Will by d3 instead of d6. If a character ever decides to take missions by themselves, then they reduce the Perception level of zombies by 1, but they take 2 Time as opposed to 1 for ‘Per - Search’ checks.

This ability can be combined with other bonuses from skills or equipment (i.e. being equipped with a scope). This can be taken with the Sniper skill without taking up an additional skill choice if you have the prerequisites for both and are not restricted by Tier. Also, a character armed with either a semi or fully-automatic pistol or rifle who does not move can fire multiple shots at a single target without penalties for making multiple shots.

The main feature of this skill is that rugged independence and simplicity of lifestyle are mandatory, as well as experience being away from civilization for long periods of time. The character has increased ability to survive for prolonged periods of time using basic tools. Characters with this skill will be granted a Perception bonus of +15 for 'Per - Survival (biome)' checks. Once a safe place or regular food supply is found, you do not have to roll checks to find it again unless you are sidetracked or disoriented somehow. Note that this skill only extends to a single biome, and not all 'Per - Survival' checks they make, so a character must choose a specific biome when selecting this skill. The available biomes are as follows: Temperate Forest, Tropical Rain Forest, Grassland, Desert, Chaparral, Marine, Freshwater, Tundra, Taiga, Ice, and Urban. Also, the Degradation rate of '10 Essentials' equipment is reduced by half. The Training Time and prerequisite Tier is reduced for taking additional biomes as additional Survivalist skills. This represents a character having the fundamentals of survival to a reflex level of understanding. Subsequent biomes count as 1st Tier instead of 4th Tier *** (Needs to be fully implemented) ****.

A switch hitter is a baseball player who is able to hit on either side of the plate. This kind of dexterity serves a player well against zombies as they are able to make use of weapons regardless of the stance they are in. They can even make use of cumbersome or complex weapons to their maximum efficiency. If a character can make multiple attacks with a complex weapon where one of the weapon's types is bludgeon (i.e. bludgeon/piercing, bludgeon/slashing), a character can make one of the attacks with the bludgeon and another attack with the other type without penalty. This is only allowed if the FC of the weapon allows for multiple attacks within the same turn.

Warlord - (Tier 1)
A warlord is someone that is so depraved, so hateful and full of rage that their general anger infects those around them, and brings them to super human levels of bloodthirsty behavior that is borderline suicidal. This person leads by example by fearlessly (and foolishly at times) charging headlong into conflict with reckless disregard for personal safety. Characters like these are typically those who have lost everything and want nothing more than to die taking down as many zombies as they can. If the character with this skill leads a formation that involves melee fighting, then for all melee attacks, all those in formation gain +15 to their Attack. If the character with this skill dies, then the formation is automatically broken and all in formation must make a Willpower check to resist Panic. All characters in this formation can automatically go 'Death or Glory' if the player desires as opposed to at a GM's discretion. The character also gets a +25 Empathy bonus when making 'Emp - Diplomacy (Intimidation)' checks.

All equipment manufacture missions have an increased chance of success of +15% when modifying a weapon after a character has had 'Weapon Familiarity' skill at least three times (so, having killed 30 total zombies with the weapon).
