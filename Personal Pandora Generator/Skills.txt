Agility - (Tier 1)
Characters with this skill get a +5 bonus to Strength for climbing and jumping. They also get +1 Defense due to an increased ability to dodge; this bonus is not given to a character that is Surprised or Panicked. This skill may push a character above their normal maximum of having a Base Defense of 5. In addition, a character with this skill is capable of moving their body to reduce the effectiveness of attacks made against them. This includes attacks made by zombies. If a character with this skill loses a Grapple check then every area of their body has a base Bite Resistance of 15%. This can be combined with physical armor, but only grants an additional +5% to the armor's Bite Resistance instead of the normal +15%.

Archery - (Tier 3)
A character has had significant practice with a bow and arrow and can accurately shoot one. When using bow style weapons, a character can add half of their Perception attribute to their close damage range to a maximum total ZK% of 50%. The exception to this is compound bows which have no cap on the maximum total ZK% granted by this skill. If characters do not move, then they may add this bonus to the medium damage range as well. At long range, a hit is nearly impossible without this skill. Otherwise, the long range is reduced to having a 5% chance of causing a kill, even if it would normally be higher.
