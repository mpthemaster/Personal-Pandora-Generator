Agility - (Tier 1)
Characters with this skill get a +5 bonus to Strength for climbing and jumping. They also get +1 Defense due to an increased ability to dodge; this bonus is not given to a character that is Surprised or Panicked. This skill may push a character above their normal maximum of having a Base Defense of 5. In addition, a character with this skill is capable of moving their body to reduce the effectiveness of attacks made against them. This includes attacks made by zombies. If a character with this skill loses a Grapple check then every area of their body has a base Bite Resistance of 15%. This can be combined with physical armor, but only grants an additional +5% to the armor's Bite Resistance instead of the normal +15%.

Archery - (Tier 3)
A character has had significant practice with a bow and arrow and can accurately shoot one. When using bow style weapons, a character can add half of their Perception attribute to their close damage range to a maximum total ZK% of 50%. The exception to this is compound bows which have no cap on the maximum total ZK% granted by this skill. If characters do not move, then they may add this bonus to the medium damage range as well. At long range, a hit is nearly impossible without this skill. Otherwise, the long range is reduced to having a 5% chance of causing a kill, even if it would normally be higher.

For someone who has played baseball, an understanding of the bat's "sweet spot" can lead to a better hit. In this fashion, a person who has a feel for a bludgeon's sweet spot can deliver more effective blows. If only making a single attack at close range with a Bludgeoning Weapon of any kind then you can add 15 to your Melee Attack. Also, using a bludgeoning weapon to knock a zombie prone will grant double the bonus that the bludgeoning weapon allows to Attack to see if the zombie is knocked prone. Typically this means that the bonus of +10 is increased to +20 but some bludgeons grant different bonuses that can make this higher or lower.

A character can declare as an action that they are 'Defending', while doing so, they no longer have a natural maximum for their Defense value, even if knocked prone. It is treated as having whatever Defense they would have had if they were not restricted to 5. Note that a character may not perform any other actions while 'Defending' other than make Grapple checks and move. A character that is Panicked may not use this ability.

Fast Shot - (Tier 3)
It is possible to train to prioritize targets and fire at multiple targets without losing much accuracy. This sort of training is almost exclusively reserved for police or military, as even practiced civilian marksmen rarely practice speed shooting at multiple targets to the level this skill would require. Character suffers no penalties for firing at multiple targets in a single turn provided all the targets are within a frontal 90 degree firing arc. They still take penalties for multiple shots.

Grenadier - (Tier 2)
If your weapon of choice is thrown and you have experience in sports (like baseball) then you can excel at placing explosives or incendiaries with a well-aimed throw. Attacks using thrown weapons, grenades and Molotov cocktails increase their Lethality by 10 at all ranges, and Lethalities that are marked with a 0 count as 10 when thrown by a character with this skill. Lethalities marked with a (-) are unchanged, however.

Gunslinger - (Tier 3)
Your style of shooting is saturation based. While this is not the best tactic for combating zombies, you seem to compensate by being able to maintain accuracy despite the volume of shots you fire. Character may increase the FC of any handgun they carry by 2 if they're firing at one target, or they can fire at multiple targets without taking penalties for firing at multiple targets. You still take penalties for firing multiple shots.

+5 to Ranged Attack.
If firing at one target:
 +2 to the FC of any handgun.
If firing at multiple targets:
 No multiple target penality.

Gunsmithing - (Tier 4)
You excel at tinkering with firearms to make them more effective. More often than not, this skill is used to make non-intrusive modifications that simply undo the government mandated restrictions that put a damper on ammo capacity or rate of fire. A character can clear jammed firearms in the field as a regular action during an encounter. They may also reduce the Degradation of gun cleaning kits by half. This skill also represents a character's ability to modify firearms to be more effective at dealing damage or improving their capacity or rate of fire; unfortunately, this makes weapons more dangerous and frequently damages the weapon. The more extensive the modification, the less stable the weapon becomes. Most of these modifications are undoing modifications to the weapons that are government mandated. Regardless of the desired modification, the modification itself is taken as an ‘Equipment Manufacture’ mission and can be one of the following: Ammo Increase: Increase the Ammo of a weapon by 20% by removing government mandated ammo plugs. This modification can be made to magazines as well as firearms themelves, provided the firearm does not hold their ammunition in magazines. No side effects. Tinker: Increase the chance of success of any Stronghold mission that involves the maintenance, repair or modification of firearms by +15%. Rapid Fire: Increase FC of a weapon by 25% rounding down. Each time the player fires more than the weapon's original FC the weapon is subject to 'Dulling'. Armor Piercing: Increase all Lethalities by 15. Weapon is subject to 'Dulling'.

Handyman - (Tier 3)
A professional jack-of-all-trades, the handyman is knowledgeable about many aspects of home maintenance which are valuable when maintaining a stronghold. Characters with this skill have basic working knowledge of construction, wiring, plumbing and mechanics, and given the proper tools this character is capable of working on any of these areas. These people also have a strong working knowledge of tools and their proper use. Grant this character a +5 bonus to Perception when making any checks for upgrades to the Stronghold or item creation. Note that using Gestalt dice to increase the bonus only applies to one kind of area of knowledge (construction, wiring, plumbing, etc), not all of them.

Healer - (Tier 3)
This is not unlike Basic First Aid, but it emphasizes that medical training is a mandatory part of a profession and requires that on multiple occasions first aid training be put to use. Increase Health recovery during natural healing by 1d6. The target must not move or perform any actions. If the character with this skill has any other first aid skill then they can increase the natural healing by +2 (so 1d6 would become 1d6+2) from the existing bonus.

While natural healing:

 If combined with another

Healthy - (Tier 3)
A lot of people would call themselves healthy, but to qualify for this skill, you must eat right and must be on a strict exercise regiment. Character gets +10 Health. The character also gets 2 bonus Gestalt Dice for use in Strength skills only. Secondary: Add +1 to all natural healing rolls a character makes, so restoring 2d3 health will increase to 2d3+1 for example.
